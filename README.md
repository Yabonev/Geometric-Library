#### C++ Project using OOP Principles in implementing and manipulating basic 2D shapes and sets of shapes.


-The list of the basic shapes: **circle, ring, triangle, square, rectangle.**

-__Figure__ is an abstract class used in the __Picture__ class(set of shapes with certain function for set manipulation).

-Each shape has its own *header* file for declaration and *cpp* file for implementation in the *Geometry_Library* folder.
